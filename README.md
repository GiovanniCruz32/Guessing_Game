This is my own spin on the number guessing game program.
Instead of giving the player multiple guesses, I added a difficulty select.
Simply type "Easy", "Medium", or "Hard". The first letter has to be capitalized.
Then enter your guess.
Using multiple nested elif statements in a while loop, your guess is checked with the random number for equality.
A message is displayed telling you whether or not you won and displays the correct answer.
